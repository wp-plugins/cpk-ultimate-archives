An improved version of the default WP Archives widget that allows complex filtering.

== Description ==

Use this widget to filter your archives.  For example if you'd only like archives for posts in category 2, simply enter 'cat=2' into the widget settings form.  The widget allows very complex filtering rules.  You can even alter the number of posts displayed on an archive page.

== Installation ==

1. Either use the built-in plugin installer, or download the zip and extract to your 'wp-content/plugins' folder.
2. Activate the plugin in Plugins > Installed Plugins
3. Go to Appearance > Widgets in your dashboard
4. Add the CPK Ultimate Archives widget to one of your sidebars.
5. Enter a query filter string (supports most of these <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Parameters'>Parameters</a>)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What can I put in the 'query' field?

You can use most parameters described <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Parameters'>here</a>.  For instance:

cat=2 - Just posts in category 2.
cat=-2 - All posts except those in category 2.
